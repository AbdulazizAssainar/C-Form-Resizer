# CSharp Form Resizer

CSharp Form Resizer is a C# utility for dynamically resizing and managing controls on a Windows Form. This tool simplifies the process of adapting controls to different form sizes while maintaining proper proportions and font scaling.

## Features

- **Automatic Control Resizing**: Resize controls and font sizes based on the form's dimensions.
  
- **Panel Support**: Automatically adjusts controls within panels for a comprehensive layout solution.

- **Maintain Aspect Ratio**: Keeps the original aspect ratio of controls, ensuring a visually consistent interface.

## Usage

1. Include the `ControlLayoutManager.cs` file in your C# project.
2. Call `LoadControls()` during the form load to capture the original state of controls.
3. Implement the desired resizing logic, possibly triggered by form size changes.
4. Customize font scaling and other parameters as needed.

## Example

```csharp
// Instantiate and load controls
ControlLayoutManager layout = new ControlLayoutManager();
layout.LoadControls();

// Implement resizing logic (e.g., on form size changed)
private void Form_SizeChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    layout.ResizeChildrenControls();
}
```
